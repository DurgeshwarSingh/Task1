# Task1
In this task we are covering network basic understanding 

As we know network means connection between devices anytype of device ðŸ˜…
and some people thing network and networking meaning is same but networking means to share or exchange information between devices in a network

Ok,Before going to scan ports
lets some gain knowledge of TCP
and UDP

In Simple words TCP (Transmission control protocol) which is a reliable connection oriented protocol means 
it first make connection and then
encrypts the traffic and then share or exchange any kind of files,info,data etc.
It used in applications and web technology.

UDP(User datagram protocol) which is a connection less and not a reliable protocol then why we use this because it is used for livestreams , games because if we make connection then we start the match it taks lot of time ðŸ¤£
